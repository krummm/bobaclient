All commands will be ran with the structure of 'bobaclient [flag] [flag] [flag] filename.xyz
The first flag here is always required, and the second flag is optional for things such as randomized filename.
The maximum amount of flags possible is three.

Valid flags:

'bobaclient h' to display help message.
'bobaclient u' to upload the specified file to bobashare and return the URL.
'bobaclient u r' to upload the specified file with a randomized name to bobashare and return the URL.
'bobaclient u z' in the parent directory of the folder you would like to upload all files to bobashare as a .zip and return the URL.
'bobaclient u z r' does the same as 'bobaclient u z', with a randomized filename.

Example command: bobaclient u filename.xyz
Example command: bobaclient u r filename.xyz
```
